A simple face detector GUI program using OpenCV and PySimpleGUI.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you run the face detector on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
- python - You need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- OpenCV
- PySimpleGUI
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install PySimpleGUI
```
## How to run
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Install the required packages using pip
- Run the script using the following command python face_detector.py

## Functionality
The script opens up a GUI window and captures a video stream from the default camera. The video stream is then processed to detect faces using the Haar cascades method. The number of faces detected is displayed on the GUI window.
